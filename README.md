2048 for Android
This is the android port of the 2048 game made by Gabriele Cirulli https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048 It's nothing fancy, just a webview that loads the localy stored html files of the original game. I just wanted to make it instantly playable without internet (the app doesn't require any permissions) and with a quick access icon for my smartphone.
